This is [my page](https://filipecard.github.io/my_page/#/), it summarizes my personal and professional profile as well as contact and networking information.

## Used Tech 

I used Flutter for the development of this page, with the following specs:

    - sdk: 
        '>=2.18.0-271.2.beta <3.0.0'
        
    - dependencies:
        cupertino_icons: ^1.0.2
        [url_launcher](https://pub.dev/packages/url_launcher): ^6.1.5

A few resources to get you started if this is your first Flutter project:

- [Lab: Write your first Flutter app](https://docs.flutter.dev/get-started/codelab)
- [Cookbook: Useful Flutter samples](https://docs.flutter.dev/cookbook)

For help getting started with Flutter development, view the
[online documentation](https://docs.flutter.dev/), which offers tutorials,
samples, guidance on mobile development, and a full API reference.
